# OTA Firmware Update Workflow for ESP‑IDF Projects

This document describes the **fully automatic OTA (Over‑The‑Air) update system** implemented in the project. The system automatically:

- Injects **git version information**, **build ID**, and **git hashes** into the firmware.
- Detects the presence of the OTA module (`ED_OTA.h`) and **conditionally** compresses the binary with LZ4 and copies it to a shared folder.
- Uses **CMake** and a **Python helper script** to keep the source code clean (placeholders are replaced at build time).
- No manual `menuconfig` steps – detection is based on file existence and is fully version‑controlled.

The **device‑side OTA logic** is triggered via **MQTT commands** (JSON format on the `cmd` topic). This document explains both the **build‑time pipeline** and the **run‑time OTA flow**.

## Architecture Overview

The system is split into two parts:

- **Build‑time (host)**:
  - CMake extracts git metadata, generates `version.h`, and (if OTA is enabled) compresses the final `.bin` with LZ4 and copies it to a network share.
  - A Python script runs before compilation to replace placeholder strings in `main.cpp` with the actual values from `version.h`. This keeps the source file readable (placeholders like `"v0.0.0-0-dirty"`) while ensuring the firmware contains the correct version.

- **Run‑time (device)**:
  - The `ED_OTA` component uses HTTPS + LZ4 streaming to download the compressed firmware from a web server.
  - MQTT commands (`FWUP`, `FWCO`, `FWQS`) control the update process.

The following diagram shows the **build‑time pipeline**:

## Project Structure

Key files and their roles:

| File / Directory | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| `CMakeLists.txt` (root) | Detects project name from folder prefix (`P029_kiln` → `P029`). Runs the Python version‑injection script as a pre‑build step. Defines OTA post‑build compression (if OTA module present). |
| `main/CMakeLists.txt` | Git version extraction (handles tagged and untagged commits). Detects OTA module by checking for `components/ED_OTA.h`. Generates `version.h` from `version.h.in`. Registers the component **without** `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` (to avoid a CMake parsing bug). Uses `target_compile_definitions` after registration to set `ENABLE_OTA`. |
| `main/version.h.in` | Template for `version.h`. Contains `@FW_...@` placeholders that are replaced by CMake. Also uses `#cmakedefine ENABLE_OTA 1` to optionally define the macro. |
| `tools/update_version_comment.py` | Python script that reads the generated `build/main/version.h` and replaces the placeholder strings in the `GIT_fwInfo` struct inside `main.cpp` (e.g., `GIT_VERSION = "v0.0.0-0-dirty"` → `"v0.0.0-0"`). Runs before every build. |
| `components/ED_OTA/` (submodule) | Contains `ED_OTA.h` and `ED_OTA.cpp` – the OTA update logic (HTTPS + LZ4 streaming, MQTT command handlers). |
| `main/main.cpp` | Contains the `GIT_fwInfo` struct with **literal placeholder strings**. These are replaced by the Python script at build time. The struct is used by other modules to access version information. |

---

## Build Workflow (Step‑by‑Step)

### 1. Project name detection (root CMakeLists.txt)

The folder name (e.g. `P029_kiln`) is read, and the part before the first underscore is extracted (`P029`). This becomes `PROJECT_NAME`. It is used for the output binary and the compressed file name.

```cmake
get_filename_component(CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR} NAME)
string(REGEX REPLACE "^([^_]+).*" "\\1" PROJECT_PREFIX "${CURRENT_FOLDER_NAME}")
if(PROJECT_PREFIX MATCHES "^P[0-9][0-9][0-9]")
    set(PROJECT_NAME "${PROJECT_PREFIX}")
endif()
```

### 2. Git version extraction (main/CMakeLists.txt)

- `git describe --tags --long --dirty --always` and `git rev-parse HEAD` are executed.
- The output is parsed:
  - If a tag like `v1.2.3-...` exists → `VERSION_STRING = "v1.2.3-4"` (or `-dirty`).
  - If no tag (e.g., `138a497-dirty`) → fallback: `VERSION_STRING = "v0.0.0-0"` (or `-dirty`), and `GIT_SHORT_HASH` is set to `g138a497`.
- `BUILD_ID` is generated: `P{timestamp}-{short_hash_without_g}` (e.g., `P20250430-143022-138a497`).

The parsing logic in `main/CMakeLists.txt` is robust and handles both tagged and untagged commits:

```cmake
if(GIT_DESCRIBE MATCHES "^v([0-9.]+)-(.*)-(\\d+)-(g[0-9a-f]+)(-dirty)?$")
    # tagged case
    ...
else()
    # untagged fallback
    set(VERSION_BASE "0.0.0")
    set(COMMIT_COUNT "0")
    set(GIT_TAG "untagged")
    string(REGEX REPLACE "^([a-f0-9]+)(-dirty)?$" "\\1" GIT_SHORT_HASH "${GIT_DESCRIBE}")
    ...
endif()
```

### 3. OTA module detection

```cmake
file(GLOB_RECURSE OTA_HEADER_FOUND
    "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/components/ED_OTA.h"
    "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/components/*/ED_OTA.h"
)
if(OTA_HEADER_FOUND)
    set(ENABLE_OTA 1)
else()
    set(ENABLE_OTA 0)
endif()
```

### 4. Generate `version.h`

`configure_file` processes `main/version.h.in`, replacing all `@VAR@` placeholders with the current values. The resulting `version.h` is placed in `build/main/version.h`. It defines macros like `FW_GIT_VERSION`, `FW_GIT_TAG`, `FW_GIT_HASH`, `FW_FULL_HASH`, `FW_BUILD_ID`, and optionally `ENABLE_OTA` (via `#cmakedefine`).

### 5. Component registration

To avoid a CMake parsing bug where `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` is misinterpreted as a directory, the `idf_component_register` call does **not** include that keyword. Instead, `target_compile_definitions` is used after registration:

```cmake
idf_component_register(
    SRCS "main.cpp" "$ENV{ESP_HEADERS}/x509_crt_bundle.S"
    INCLUDE_DIRS "." ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}
    REQUIRES ED_WIFI ED_MQTT diag ED_S_JSON
)

target_compile_definitions(${COMPONENT_TARGET} PRIVATE ENABLE_OTA=${ENABLE_OTA})
```

### 6. Python pre‑build script (root CMakeLists.txt)

The script `tools/update_version_comment.py` is set to run **before every build** using a custom target:

```cmake
find_package(Python3 REQUIRED)
add_custom_target(
    inject_version_before_build
    COMMAND ${Python3_EXECUTABLE} ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tools/update_version_comment.py
    WORKING_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}
    COMMENT "Injecting current git version into main.cpp"
    VERBATIM
)
add_dependencies(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf inject_version_before_build)
```

### 7. OTA post‑build compression (root CMakeLists.txt)

If the OTA module was detected, the final firmware binary is compressed with LZ4 and copied to the shared folder (`//raspi00/fware/`). The target `gen_project_binary` is used to ensure the binary exists before compression.

```cmake
if(ENABLE_OTA)
    find_program(LZ4_EXECUTABLE lz4)
    if(LZ4_EXECUTABLE)
        set(FW_BIN "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.bin")
        set(COMPRESSED_FW "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}_${PROJECT_VER_CACHE}.bin.lz4")
        set(SHARED_FOLDER "//raspi00/fware")
        add_custom_command(
            TARGET gen_project_binary
            POST_BUILD
            COMMAND ${LZ4_EXECUTABLE} -9 --no-frame-crc -f ${FW_BIN} ${COMPRESSED_FW}
            COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy ${COMPRESSED_FW} ${SHARED_FOLDER}/
            COMMENT "LZ4 compressing OTA firmware as ${PROJECT_NAME}_${PROJECT_VER_CACHE}.bin.lz4"
            VERBATIM
        )
    endif()
endif()
```

---

## Version Injection into `main.cpp`

The file `main.cpp` contains a struct `GIT_fwInfo` with **literal placeholder strings**:

```cpp
namespace ED_SYSINFO {
struct GIT_fwInfo {
    static constexpr const char* GIT_VERSION = "v0.0.0-0-dirty";
    static constexpr const char* GIT_TAG     = "untagged";
    static constexpr const char* GIT_HASH    = "g0000000";
    static constexpr const char* FULL_HASH   = "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
    static constexpr const char* BUILD_ID    = "P00000000-000000-0000000";
};
}
```

These placeholders are replaced at **build time** by the Python script `tools/update_version_comment.py`. The script:

1. Locates the generated `build/main/version.h`.
2. Reads the values of `FW_GIT_VERSION`, `FW_GIT_TAG`, etc.
3. Opens `main/main.cpp` and replaces the quoted strings inside the struct with the actual values.
4. Saves the file – the next compilation step uses the updated source.

This approach keeps the source tree clean (placeholders are visible for documentation) while ensuring the firmware always contains the correct, up‑to‑date version information.

---

## OTA Post‑Build Compression & Deployment

When the OTA module is present (i.e., `components/ED_OTA/ED_OTA.h` exists), the build system automatically:

1. **Compresses** the final `.bin` file with LZ4 (maximum compression, level 9, force overwrite).
2. **Names** the compressed file as `{PROJECT_NAME}_{VERSION_STRING}.bin.lz4` (e.g., `P029_v0.0.0-0.bin.lz4`).
3. **Copies** it to the shared folder `//raspi00/fware/` (adjustable).

The shared folder must be served by an HTTPS server (e.g., nginx, Apache) so that devices can download the file. The device expects URLs like `https://raspi00/fware/P029_v0.0.0-0.bin.lz4`.

---

## MQTT Commands & Triggering (Device Side)

The device subscribes to the MQTT topic `cmd` (configurable in `ED_MQTT_dispatcher`). Commands are sent as **JSON** objects with fields `"cmd"` and `"data"`.

### Available OTA Commands

| Command | Description | Data field |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `FWUP` | Launch OTA update. | `"latest"` (or a specific version string like `"1.2.3-5"`) |
| `FWCO` | Confirm the running image as valid (prevents rollback). | (empty) |
| `FWQS` | Query OTA image status (PENDING_VERIFY, VALID, INVALID). | (empty) |

### Using `mosquitto_pub`

Update to the latest version:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h broker_ip -t "cmd" -m '{"cmd":"FWUP","data":"latest"}'
```

Update to a specific version (e.g., `v1.2.3-5`):
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h broker_ip -t "cmd" -m '{"cmd":"FWUP","data":"1.2.3-5"}'
```

Confirm new firmware after reboot:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h broker_ip -t "cmd" -m '{"cmd":"FWCO"}'
```

Query OTA status:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h broker_ip -t "cmd" -m '{"cmd":"FWQS"}'
```

### Internal Flow (Device)

- `OTAmanager` registers the three commands during its constructor.
- When `FWUP` is received, `cmd_launchUpdate` creates a FreeRTOS task `ota_update_task`.
- The task:
  - Scans the primary HTTP directory (and a fallback) for files matching `{PROJECT_NAME}_v*.bin.lz4`.
  - Downloads the file in chunks, decompresses via LZ4 streaming, and writes the OTA partition.
  - On success, sets the new partition as bootable and reboots.
- After reboot, the application (or a manual `FWCO` command) must call `cmd_otaValidate(true)` to mark the image as valid and cancel rollback.

---

## Configuration & Customisation

### Shared folder path (build host)

Edit the top‑level `CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
set(SHARED_FOLDER "//raspi00/fware")   # UNC path for Windows
```

### HTTP server URL (device side)

Modify `ED_OTA.cpp` (or move constants to a header):
```cpp
static inline const char fwStorageUrl[30] = "https://your-server/fware/";
static inline const char fwObsUrl[30] = "https://your-server/fware/obs/";
```

### LZ4 compression level

In the top‑level `CMakeLists.txt`, replace `-9` with another level (1‑9):
```cmake
COMMAND ${LZ4_EXECUTABLE} -5 --no-frame-crc -f ${FW_BIN} ${COMPRESSED_FW}
```

### Git tag format

For the version parser to work correctly, tags should follow the pattern `vX.Y.Z-...` (e.g., `v1.0.0-0`). The fallback `v0.0.0-0` is used when no tag is present.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `Include directory '.../COMPILE_DEFINITIONS' is not a directory`

- **Cause**: A known CMake parsing bug when `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` is used inside `idf_component_register` with certain spacing or line endings.
- **Fix**: Remove `COMPILE_DEFINITIONS` from the registration call and use `target_compile_definitions` **after** the registration, as shown in the corrected `main/CMakeLists.txt`.

### `version.h` not found or empty macros

- Run `idf.py reconfigure` to generate `version.h`.
- Ensure `main/version.h.in` contains the required `FW_*` macros.
- Check that the git parsing logic correctly extracts `GIT_SHORT_HASH`, `GIT_FULL_HASH`, etc.

### Python script does not replace placeholders

- Run the script manually to see errors:
  ```bash
  python tools/update_version_comment.py
  ```
- Ensure `main.cpp` contains the exact struct with placeholder strings as shown above.
- Check that `build/main/version.h` exists and contains the `FW_*` macros.

### LZ4 compression fails (`lz4: command not found`)

- Install LZ4 on Windows: download `lz4.exe` from the official GitHub release and place it in a folder on your `PATH` (e.g., `C:\Tools\LZ4`).
- Alternatively, use the ESP‑IDF MSYS2 environment and run `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-lz4`.

### Shared folder copy fails (Permission denied)

- Ensure the build user has write access to the network share. On Windows, you may need to map the share as a network drive (e.g., `net use Z: \\raspi00\fware`).
- Use a forward‑slash UNC path: `//raspi00/fware`.

### Device cannot download the firmware

- Verify that the HTTP server serves the `.lz4` file with MIME type `application/octet-stream`.
- Check that the filename matches the pattern expected by the device (e.g., `P029_v1.0.0-0.bin.lz4`).
- Confirm that the URL in `fwStorageUrl` is correct and reachable from the device.

## Final Notes

This system provides a **fully automatic, version‑controlled OTA pipeline**. No manual steps (like `menuconfig`) are required – the presence of the OTA module in the source tree decides the behaviour.

- The **CMake scripts** handle git version extraction, `version.h` generation, and conditional post‑build compression.
- The **Python script** keeps the source code clean by replacing placeholders at build time.
- The **device‑side OTA** is triggered via simple MQTT commands and uses efficient LZ4 streaming.

For further customisation, refer to the inline comments in `CMakeLists.txt` files and the documentation inside `ED_OTA.h`.
